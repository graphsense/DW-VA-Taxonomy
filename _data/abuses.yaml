ponzi_scheme:
  id: ponzi_scheme
  type: concept
  prefLabel: Ponzi Scheme
  description: >
      Ponzi schemes promise high financial returns or dividends not available through traditional
      investments. Instead of investing the funds of victims, however, the con artist pays
      dividends to initial investors using the funds of subsequent investors. The scheme generally
      falls apart when the operator flees with all of the proceeds or when a sufficient number of
      new investors cannot be found to allow the continued payment of dividends.

pyramid_scheme:

  type: concept
  prefLabel: Pyramid Scheme
  description: >
      As in Ponzi schemes, the money collected from newer victims of pyramid schemes is paid to
      earlier victims to provide a veneer of legitimacy. In pyramid schemes, however, the victims
      themselves are induced to recruit further victims through the payment of recruitment commissions.
